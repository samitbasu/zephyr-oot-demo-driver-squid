A test of how to use ZephyrOS with an out of tree module.  Inspired by:

* [https://iwasz.pl/electronics/2021-06-18-out-of-tree-zephyr-module.md/] blog post
* [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62358554/zephyros-how-to-add-driver-module-to-out-of-tree-project] StackOverflow (self-answered) question
* [https://blog.golioth.io/adding-an-out-of-tree-sensor-driver-to-zephyr/] Tutorial

Weirdness -
* You cannot just make up a vendor prefix, even in an out-of-tree module.
